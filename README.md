# Local Ocean Conservation Sea Turtle Face Detection
This repository harbours the code for the collaborative capstone project by the team **Neural Nexus** towards the completion of a six months training at Refactory in AI and Machine Learning. The project is from the [Zindi](https://zindi.africa/competitions) platform and it is the  [Local Ocean Conservation Sea Turtle Face Detection](https://zindi.africa/competitions/local-ocean-conservation-sea-turtle-face-detection) aimed at challenging competitors to use the power of computer vision for face detection - a move geered towards ensuring the conservation of sea turtles and their habitants.

## About the Project 
### Description
Being able to identify individual animals is a critical aspect of modern conservation. In the case of sea turtle conservation efforts, tracking where and when individuals are spotted can help reveal patterns of movement and residency, and allow more accurate estimates of population. Sea turtles can be identified using their facial scales, which are as unique as a human fingerprint.

Local Ocean Conservation (LOC) would like to use the unique fingerprint of turtle faces to integrate facial image recognition into their existing turtle applications, which would speed up many routine conservation tasks. As a first step towards such a system, we need to develop a tool that can crop a given image to show only the important facial region, reducing the chances of an accidental match down the line.

The goal of this competition is to develop an algorithm or model that can take in an image of a sea turtle and output the position of a bounding box around that all-important scale pattern. A labelled training set with bounding box annotations has been provided.

### Dataset

The dataset contains
- 2021 images resized to 1024 pixels.
- 2023 images resized to 512 pixels.
